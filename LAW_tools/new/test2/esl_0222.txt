Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit , while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected .
On_the_one_hand , I agree with people who consider the usage of animals for their own benefit to be possible but only if they are scientists or doctors .
It is common knowledge that modern medicine makes progress and needs to examine their products but on whom will they do it if_not on animals ?
To my mind , humans should use animals ( rats or rabbits ) for inventing new medicines .
Speaking about animals ' meat , in my opinion , it can not be helped .
On_the_other_hand , the society supports defenders of animal rights .
I think it is great that people eventually realize that the number of animals reduces every day because_of humans .
So there are a_lot_of rescue programs for different animals around the world .
I admire such kind of people , their strong will and faith in what they do .
But defenders of animals can not propose yet the real alternate of using animals for the human purposes .
Summing up , I 'd like to say that people can not live without animals .
We need animals not only to eat their meat but for some high aims like friendship , medicine and technology .
Some animals are organ donors for humans , animals help scientists to examine new medicines , and besides the first creatures in space were animals .
Unfortunately or fortunately , human is the most powerful and intelligent animal on earth so it is up to us not to do more harm than good , to change something that can help every creature live in peace .
