During several last years a large amount of money was invested in waste disposal in the UK to lessen the harm to the nature made by industrialwaste .
It is well known that the production of waste by industries increases from year to year .
For_example , the amount of waste produced byBritish industries increased from 800000 tons in 2008 to 1000000 tons in 2011 .
That is the reason why more and more money are invested in wastedisposal in the UK every year .
From 2008 to 2011 6,5 million Euros were invested in total .
However , the number of received complaints to localcouncils regarding environmental damage did not decrease .
On the average , each year local councils received 10_thousand complaints more than inthe previous year .
Thus , from 2008 to 2011 the number of complaints increased from 35_thousand to 60_thousand - almost twice .
That means thatthe investments made by the British government is not enough and some additional efforts should be applied to make a positive influence on theenvironment of the UK .
