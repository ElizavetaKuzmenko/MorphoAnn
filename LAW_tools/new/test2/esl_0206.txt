The first chart demonstrates that the total amount of waste has increased from 800_thousand tones to one_million in a four-year period .
Thelowest rate was in the_year_2009 : according_to the chart , it was only 700_thousand tones , which is less for 100_thousand tones than the rate ofthe previous year .
However , next year the rate reached its peak - it was 1 200_thousand tones .
Thereby , the rate which was reached by the nextyear , namely one_million tones , could be considered as a success .
This data should be compared with the amount of investment which is made to dispose the waste .
It is highly predictable that these rates shouldvary inversely : the more amount of money is invested in reducing the waste , the less is the waste .
However , the observed situation is not likethat .
The rates of investment go up together with the rates of waste .
The rates of investment has increased from one_million euro to 2,5 millionduring these four years .
It has to be noted , however , that the amount of investment remains at the same level ( 1,5 million euro ) in 2009 and2010 , which caused a dramatic rise of the amount of waste .
In other words , the chart shows that the amount of money invested should be increasedpermanently in_order_to escape the abrupt changes in the environment .
Concerning the level of public discontent , it is going up permanently during all the four years with no relation to the rate leaps which werediscussed above .
Nevertheless , the speed of the growth is different .
From 2008 till 2009 the rate increased for five_thousand of complaints : from 35_thousand to 40_thousand .
But by the year_2010 the increase of complaints was more crucial : the rate has grown for 10_thousand ( from 40thousand to 50_thousand ) .
Nonetheless the amount of waste has dropped by the year_2011 , the amount of complaints have not decreased : this ratehas reached 60_thousand .
Thus , these charts demonstrate a correlation between the amount of money that are invested in saving the nature and the amount of waste .
On thecontrary , no correlation between the level of real waste and the level of public discontent could be observed .
