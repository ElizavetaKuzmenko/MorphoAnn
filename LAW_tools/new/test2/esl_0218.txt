Nowadays many sport events become incredibly popular and TV channels try to show as many football matches , athletic events or Olympic competitions as possible .
It involved a_lot_of money in sports and caused big changes in this industry .
Some people believe that the spirit of sporting competitions has been destroyed by the amount of money , while others do not pay much attention to this changes .
Sometimes famous athletes avoid competitions , where they can not earn much and I suppose this is the main reason , why so many people worry about money in sports .
In_order_to earn much money , sportsmen pay more attention to sponsors ; avoid fair play .
Nevertheless , athletes still do their job and I think we should not count their salary .
By the way , sport corruption rises every day and it is also very important problem .
I think that governments must deal with this serious problem .
However , it is very important to popularize sport in the whole world and the more TV channels show different sport competitions , the more children watch these events .
I suppose , that with the help of money , we can promote sport in Africa , in different poor countries , where it is necessary .
It is great and I hope that amount of money can change the quality of live translations , organization of big competitions .
In conclusion , athletes are people whose aim of life is sport and I hope that nobody and nothing can kill the spirit of competitions .
And in the future we will see only positive side of money .
